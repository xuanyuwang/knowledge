# Project Log - 2026-02-20

## Progress

- B-SF-3 fix PR merged to main ([PR #25829](https://github.com/cresta/go-servers/pull/25829))

## Details

- Rebased onto latest main to pick up proto test fix (INSI-2481 `ChartAttributeValue.Operator` validation by posiceanu-cresta had broken unrelated `evaluate_analytics_chart_*` tests — fixed separately on main)
- All 14 CI checks passed after rebase
- Addressed PR review comments:
  - Hintful: simplified comments to reference CONVI-6284 instead of B-SF-3 behavioral standard IDs
  - Hintful: acknowledged verbose comments, noted plan to consolidate into `shared/user-filter` with package-level README
  - flatplate: confirmed no other endpoints depend on the intersection bug
  - cursor[bot] Bugbot: dismissed nil-panic false positive (proto deserialization never produces nil elements, same pattern as existing `updateGroundTruthUsers`)
- Updated project documentation to reflect merged status
