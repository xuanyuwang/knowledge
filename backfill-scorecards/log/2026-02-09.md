# Project Log - 2026-02-09

Created: 2026-02-09T13:20 UTC
Updated: 2026-02-09T14:05 UTC

## Progress

- [x] Run split jobs for cvs and oportun (3 time periods each) - **Failed due to heartbeat timeout**
- [x] Cancel split jobs and switch to single-day approach
- [x] Test single-day approach with Jan 1 - **Success!**
- [x] Run all 31 days for cvs and oportun
- [ ] Monitor single-day jobs for completion
- [ ] Final status update

## Context

Yesterday (2026-02-08):
- 256/260 backfill jobs completed successfully
- 4 failed: marriott, united-east (heartbeat timeout), cvs, oportun (deadlock)
- Retry worked for marriott and united-east
- cvs and oportun kept failing due to high volume

## Failed Approaches

### Attempt 1: 10-day split (Failed)
Split January into 3 periods (~10 days each) - still hit heartbeat timeout.

### Attempt 2: Single-day split (Success!)
Split January into 31 individual days - each day completes quickly.

## Single-Day Approach

Since cvs and oportun have millions of conversations, we process one day at a time.

**Test run (Jan 1):**
- oportun: Completed in ~36 seconds
- cvs: Completed in ~16 minutes

Scripts:
- `rerun_single_day.sh` - Run a single day
- `rerun_all_days.sh` - Run all 31 days

## Status (2026-02-09 ~14:05 UTC)

### Jobs Created

| Day | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Jan 1 | ✅ Completed (test run) |
| Jan 2-31 | 🔄 Running (60 workflows) |

**Total: 62 workflows** (2 completed + 60 running)

## Overall Backfill Status

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Initial jobs | 260 |
| Completed (original) | 256 |
| Completed (retry) | 2 (marriott, united-east) |
| Single-day jobs | 62 (cvs × 31, oportun × 31) |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Wait for all 60 running workflows to complete
- [ ] Verify all 62 single-day jobs succeed
- [ ] Update Linear ticket CONVI-6209 with final results
