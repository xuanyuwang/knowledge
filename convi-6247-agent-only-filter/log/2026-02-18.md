# Project Log - 2026-02-18

## Progress

- Completed **Phase 2 (FE types)** — added `listAgentOnly` filter key and state types across 3 files.
- Created branch `xuanyu/convi-6247-agent-only-filter` in director repo (worktree at `director-convi-6247`).
- Opened PR: [director #16777](https://github.com/cresta/director/pull/16777).

## Details

### Phase 2 changes (3 files)

1. **`FilterKey.ts`** — Added `LIST_AGENT_ONLY = 'list_agent_only'` to `FilterKey` enum.
2. **`types.ts`** — Added `listAgentOnly?: boolean` to:
   - `CommonInsightsFiltersState` (flows to `PerformanceFiltersState`)
   - `LocalStoragePerformanceInsightsFiltersState` (persistence)
3. **`useLeaderboardsFilters.tsx`** — Added `listAgentOnly` to:
   - `DefaultLeaderboardsFiltersState` Pick (from `CommonInsightsFiltersState`)
   - `LocalStorageLeaderboardsFiltersState`
   - `INITIAL_LEADERBOARDS_FILTERS_STATE` (default: `true`)
   - `localStateToFilterState()` and `filterStateToLocalState()` (serialization)

No runtime behavior change — types-only preparation for Phases 3–5.

## Next Steps

- Phase 3: Performance page filter UI (BooleanFilter in `usePerformanceFilters`, utils registration)
- Phase 4: Leaderboard page filter UI (same pattern, disable on Manager tab)
- Phase 5: API pass-through (replace hardcoded `filterToAgentsOnly: true` with state value)
