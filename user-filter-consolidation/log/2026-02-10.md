# Project Log - 2026-02-10

## Progress

- Continued refining the behavioral standard document (`user-filter-behavioral-standard.md`)
- Updated the 2026-02-09 log with additional details from yesterday's extended session

## Details

### Behavioral Standard Refinements

Continued polishing the comprehensive behavioral standard document created yesterday. The document now covers:

- 21 sections with 45+ numbered behaviors
- Evidence from unit tests, implementation code, and caller usage patterns
- 9 identified behavioral divergences between implementations
- Two proposals: removing `hasAgentAsGroupByKey` (Section 20) and post-processing utilities (Section 21)
- Appendix mapping test cases to behaviors and listing behaviors not covered by tests

### Document Status

The behavioral standard is now in a state ready for team review. Key decisions needed from the team:
1. Combined user + group filter semantics: INTERSECTION vs UNION (Divergence 5)
2. Sorting key: resource Name vs FullName (Divergence 6)
3. Whether to adopt the `hasAgentAsGroupByKey` removal proposal
