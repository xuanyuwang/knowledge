# Project Log - 2026-02-23

## Progress

- Moved project from `go-servers/.tmp/CONVI-5565-test/` to knowledge repo as `convi-5565-scorecard-ch-pg-sync`
- Created README with overview, verification tool usage instructions
- Preserved original investigation document as `investigation.md`
- Did NOT copy compiled binaries (62MB + 143MB) — source lives in `go-servers/tools/`

## Details

### What was moved
- `CONVI-5565-COMPLETE.md` → `investigation.md` (full investigation with root cause, 3 fixes, load test results)

### What was copied
- `tools/verify_sync/main.go` + `BUILD.bazel` — single scorecard PG↔CH comparison
- `tools/test_async_order/main.go` + `BUILD.bazel` — load test for concurrent Update+Submit race

### What was NOT copied (intentionally)
- Compiled binaries (`test_async_order` 62MB, `verify_sync` 143MB) — rebuild from go-servers
- `go.mod` / `go.sum` from `.tmp/` — standalone build files, tools depend on go-servers internal packages

### How to build the tools
Both tools must be built from `go-servers/` since they import internal packages (`shared/scoring`) and proto definitions.
To use: copy `main.go` back to `go-servers/tools/<tool>/` (or just build from there if the source still exists).
