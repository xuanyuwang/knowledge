# Project Log - 2026-02-26

## Progress

- Researched and documented ClickHouse techniques for handling large IN clauses (thousands of values exceeding `max_query_size`)
- Created `clickhouse-large-in-clause-techniques.md` covering 4 approaches: increasing `max_query_size`, external data tables, temporary tables, and driver slice expansion

## Details

Key finding: The Go ClickHouse driver has first-class support for external data tables via the `ext` package, which sends filter data as binary blocks (not SQL text), completely bypassing the 256KB `max_query_size` limit. This is the recommended production approach for large IN clauses.
