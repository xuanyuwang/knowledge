## Progress

- [x] Run split jobs for cvs and oportun (3 time periods each) - **Failed due to heartbeat timeout**
- [x] Cancel split jobs and switch to single-day approach
- [x] Test single-day approach with Jan 1 - **Success!**
- [x] Run all 31 days in parallel - **Canceled (DB stress)**
- [x] Switch to sequential approach with `rerun_sequential.py`

## Failed Approaches

### Attempt 1: 10-day split
Split January into 3 periods (~10 days each) for cvs/oportun. Still hit heartbeat timeout.

### Attempt 2: All 31 days in parallel
Created 60 workflows (30 cvs + 30 oportun) at once. Caused DB stress — workflows were externally canceled.

### Attempt 3: Sequential single-day (Success)
Process one day at a time, wait for completion, then start next day.

**Test run (Jan 1):**
- oportun: Completed in ~36 seconds
- cvs: Completed in ~16 minutes

Built `rerun_sequential.py` with JSON-based progress tracking for resume after interruption.

## Scripts Created

- `rerun_single_day.sh` - Run a single day
- `rerun_all_days.sh` - Run all 31 days in parallel (don't use — causes DB stress)
- `rerun_sequential.py` - Sequential processing with tracking and resume
