# Daily Engineering Notes – 2025-11-24

## 1. Fixes (Bugs / Issues Resolved)
- Problem:
- Symptoms:
- Root Cause:
- How I Diagnosed It:
- Final Fix:
- Preventative Ideas:

## 2. Learnings (New Knowledge)
- What I learned: documentation is more and more important in coding
- Context:
I start to use AI to explore problems, which generate a good documentation of the whole trace of bugs. It's easy to share with others. 
Also, since I use AI to explore solutions, there is naturally a README for other engineers, more importantly, other engineers can use AI to understand a project quickly and start to work.
The problem of documentation before is that writing documentation is time comsuming, especially when a project is updated frequently. But since we're using AI to discuss solutions as conversations, so it's pretty easy to summarize the update to an existing documentation
- Why it's important: communation between engineers become much easier
- Example: a cron job with well documentation can be picked up by other engineers immediately
- When to apply: anytime
