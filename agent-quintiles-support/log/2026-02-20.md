# Project Log - 2026-02-20

## Progress

- Simplified quintile ranking: removed peer-group logic, all per-agent scores ranked as one flat group
- Updated knowledge docs to reflect current behaviour

## Details

### Simplified `setQuintileRankForPerAgentScores`

Removed unnecessary peer-group logic that grouped per-agent scores by non-agent dimensions (time range, criterion, team, group) before ranking. Since quintiles are only applied when grouped by `QA_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_AGENT`, all per-agent scores are ranked together as one flat group.

**Before:** Collected scores into peer groups by non-agent dimensions, ranked within each group independently.
**After:** Collects all per-agent scores into one list, sorts descending, distributes into quintiles.

Commit `1723d30` pushed to `feature/agent-quintiles` on go-servers.

### Docs updated

- `implementation-plan.md`: Removed peer-group references from quintile definition and Phase 1.2. Updated BE checklist to all ✅. Updated test list.
- `README.md`: Simplified quintile approach description to "flat ranking". Updated implementation plan summary and log history.
- `log/2026-02-19.md`: Already had the percentile-based change documented; peer-group detail now superseded by today's simplification.
