At Cresta, we believe feedback is critical to performance and the growth of every Crestan. This annual performance review covers the period from Feb 1st 2025 through Jan 31st 2026. Your completed self-review should be submitted by Sunday, February 8, 2026. Entering your feedback When you enter your feedback be specific & clear to the question / topic being answered with clear examples. Whenever possible, demonstrate how your work has impacted your team or Cresta. While it is easy to focus on recent projects, note that this is annual performance review and the full year should be considered. Reminders & Next Steps HiBob will autosave your progress on this form, so you can take breaks and return to your draft. Your manager will not be able to see your self-review until it is submitted. If you had another manager over the previous fiscal year, they may ask your previous manager for feedback in order to get a wholistic view of your performance. If you have any questions, you are always welcome to reach out the People Team via #ask-people (https://cresta.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
