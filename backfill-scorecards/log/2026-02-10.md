## Details

### Recovery from Yesterday's Interruptions

Yesterday's sequential run was interrupted by VPN drops and workflow timeouts. Today:

1. Checked tracking status — Jan 1-5, 8 completed; 6-7 timed out; 9-31 failed (network)
2. Verified days 6-7 workflows had actually completed in Temporal (just exceeded the 1h poll timeout)
3. Marked days 6-7 as completed, reset days 9-31 (network failures) to pending
4. Resumed sequential run for days 9-31

### Run Results

Multiple resume cycles needed due to VPN drops and AWS session expiry:

| Issue | Days Affected | Resolution |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Workflow poll timeout (1h) | 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 | Checked Temporal — all had actually completed |
| VPN disconnect | 9-31 (first run) | Reset to pending, resumed |
| AWS ForbiddenException | 17-31 | AWS session expired, reset and resumed |
