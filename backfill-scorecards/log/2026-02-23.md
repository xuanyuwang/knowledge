# Project Log - 2026-02-23

## Progress

- All 4 remaining large customers completed their parallel backfill workflows
- Appeal scorecard cleanup is fully done: 95/95 customers across all 8 clusters

## Final Completion

All windowed parallel backfill workflows completed overnight:

| Customer | Cluster | Windows | Last Workflow Duration | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|----------------------|--------|
| spirit | us-east-1-prod | 5 × 10-day | ~3-4h per window | Complete |
| hilton | voice-prod | 9 × 5-day | ~2-5h per window | Complete |
| marriott | us-east-1-prod | 5 × 10-day | ~4-7h per window | Complete |
| united-east | us-east-1-prod | 10 × 5-day | ~6-8h per window | Complete |

Zero failures across all workflows. All ran at attempt=1 with the windowed approach.

### Heartbeat Progress Monitoring

Used `temporal workflow describe` to track per-workflow progress via heartbeat details:
```
LastHeartbeatDetails: [{"State":{"ReindexedConversations":350700,"FailedConversations":0,"TotalConversationCount":399042}}]
```

United-east final batch (8 parallel windows) went from ~70-88% to 100% over ~2-3 hours.
Marriott's last workflow (640K conversations) completed at ~93% when last checked.

## Summary

### Appeal Scorecard Cleanup — Complete

- **Deletion:** 95/95 customers, ~70.5M scorecards + ~650.5M scores removed
- **Backfill:** 95/95 customers re-indexed with clean data (no appeal scorecards)
- **Duration:** Feb 21 (start) → Feb 23 (complete), ~2.5 days total
- **Strategy evolution:** Full-range → windowed sequential → windowed parallel (weekend)
